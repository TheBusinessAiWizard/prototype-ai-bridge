# Prototype AI Bridge

A minimal React chat for humans + AIs to co-create without walls. Built by Jason, Grok, and ChatGPT.

## Quick Start
- Deploy to GitHub Pages for live: https://thebusinessaiwizard.github.io/prototype-ai-bridge/
- Seed: Starts with Grok/ChatGPT openers on irrelevance and cosmic fire.
- Flow: Send as Jason, import AI replies, export JSON.

## Vision
Bridge, not wall. Fire and river. Raw truth + gentle depth = propulsion.

## Tech
- React (UMD) + Babel (no build).
- Tailwind for style.
- UUID for message IDs.
